# What About a Title

The problem with front matter is that the linter doesn’t know how to skip it. At least not yet. What about spelling errors?

And technically, a Markdown document with a “title” element in the front matter shouldn’t also have a [level 1 header](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/v0.17.2/doc/Rules.md#md025---multiple-top-level-headings-in-the-same-document). But this one does. I’m a rule breaker.

This is a new section, not YAML.

## A second level header

This is also a new section. YAML is only detected as front matter.
